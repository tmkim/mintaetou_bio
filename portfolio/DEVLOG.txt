3/5 - Started making my portfolio website!

Originally I wanted to try making the base Django and add projects on top, but I realized it will just be a lot simpler and cleaner to use next.js as the base and add additional projects on top.
Realistically I want to continue using both NextJS and Django, so I'm going to continue using this stack for now.

Ported over my backend and frontend from my DankBank project
    Backend was easy, all worked well
    Frontend having some issues with formatting css...
    
3/6
    Continuing to look into frontend issues, figured out it's because nextjs is using latest version of Tailwind CSS (v4), which uses a different structure than v3
    Fixed the structure of my frontend with respect to new Tailwind CSS, all good now! 
    
    Set up initial mockup of intro page
    updated navbar and links

    added Contact Me using formspree
    updated modal backgrounds to use style={{ backgroundColor: 'rgba(31, 41, 55, 0.5)' }}

    Things to fix in DankBank:
        image upload browse needs format fix 
        updating query effectively reloads entire page so you can't really type anything into search 
            and UI is unnatural when updating filter
        Make sure things look good with gray background 
        Filter buttons could look prettier
