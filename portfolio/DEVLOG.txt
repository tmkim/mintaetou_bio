3/5 - Started making my portfolio website!

Originally I wanted to try making the base Django and add projects on top, but I realized it will just be a lot simpler and cleaner to use next.js as the base and add additional projects on top.
Realistically I want to continue using both NextJS and Django, so I'm going to continue using this stack for now.

Ported over my backend and frontend from my DankBank project
    Backend was easy, all worked well
    Frontend having some issues with formatting css...
    
3/6
    Continuing to look into frontend issues, figured out it's because nextjs is using latest version of Tailwind CSS (v4), which uses a different structure than v3
    Fixed the structure of my frontend with respect to new Tailwind CSS, all good now! 
    
    Set up initial mockup of intro page
    updated navbar and links

    added Contact Me using formspree
    updated modal backgrounds to use style={{ backgroundColor: 'rgba(31, 41, 55, 0.5)' }}

    Things to fix in DankBank:
        * image upload browse needs format fix 
        updating query effectively reloads entire page so you can't really type anything into search 
            and UI is unnatural when updating filter
        * Make sure things look good with gray background 
        * Filter buttons could look prettier 

3/7
    Alright let's make those fixes to DankBank then work on fleshing out my website.

    > Image uploader:
        ** updated image upload component!
    > Filter buttons:
        ** updated filter buttons!
    > Pagination not working
        ** basically fetcher was only saving first page of data by grabbing data.results 
            ++ now grabs entire json() and grabbing count/results separately
    > Sort is kinda broken too
        -- looks like it's only sorting current page rather than sorting entire results then separating pages 
        ++ fixed sorting by moving sort logic to the backend
        ++ updated frontend to update search params based on sort 
    > data is re-rendering page every time it changes 
        ++ restructured how data is stored -> using state to prevent re-renders

    Alright I think we're pretty set on Dank Bank for now! 

3/8
    Alright so did a bit of work on restructuring my Dank Bank git project, and adding some extra features for login/logout.

    Don't really need to worry about that for my bio at the moment so we can fix that up later.
    Now let's work on my home page!
