3/5 - Started making my portfolio website!

Originally I wanted to try making the base Django and add projects on top, but I realized it will just be a lot simpler and cleaner to use next.js as the base and add additional projects on top.
Realistically I want to continue using both NextJS and Django, so I'm going to continue using this stack for now.

Ported over my backend and frontend from my DankBank project
    Backend was easy, all worked well
    Frontend having some issues with formatting css...
    
3/6
    Continuing to look into frontend issues, figured out it's because nextjs is using latest version of Tailwind CSS (v4), which uses a different structure than v3
    Fixed the structure of my frontend with respect to new Tailwind CSS, all good now!
